# Home Assistant - Life360 addon

Presence detection using the service [Life360](https://life360.com)

## General

If you want Life360 to update when you enter or leave a Life360 Place open up your router's port for the addon (default is 8081).  To test if you have it open go to `{host_url}/webhook` (ex. `https://my-assistant.duckdns.org:8081/webhook`)
